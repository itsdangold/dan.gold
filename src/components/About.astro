    <h2>Hey! I’m Dan — a designer-who codes, with 6+ years of experience building brands and products for the web.</h2>
    <p>Currently I'm on the design team at <a href="https://sentry.io" target="_blank">Sentry</a> — building application monitoring software for developers.</p>
    <p>Whether it’s branding, design systems, or product design, I have a passion for sweating the details — from the big-picture strategy, down to the micro-interactions. I have always loved working at the intersection of design and code, and being able to build things from scratch.</p>
    <p>In my spare time you can find me playing the drums, learning Spanish, and nerding out on well-kerned type!</p>
