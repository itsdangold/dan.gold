      <h2>Pitchbooking.com redesign</h2>
      <p>I was fortunate to work with Pitchbooking — a website used to book a range of facilities —  to redesign their entire website, including the marketing page, booking experience, and login flow.</p>
      <p>Working with their engineers, I was tasked with building all of the front-end UI to be implemented with the existing codebase.</p>
